Hello! My name is Gabe Albacarys and I'm a software engineer currently working
at ViaSat, Inc. in San Diego, CA. My day job is as a cloud software engineer,
where I work in our Openstack private cloud designing CI/CD tools and improving
our testing and deployment infrastructure. In my free time, I enjoy rock
climbing, music, and game development.

## Are you currently searching for a new gig?

Nah, not really. ViaSat is pretty cool. And I don't really do the whole "send me
some people you think might be interested!" thing either.

## What is your blog about?

I'm not really entirely sure yet. I'd like it to be a decent mix of
psuedo-philosophical ranting, cringeworthy attempts at comedy, and bad advice
about software engineering.

## Why would you want a blog without knowing what to write about?

So, I got a call from a recruiter at an unnamed company in San Diego a couple
days ago. They said they were extremely impressed with my GitHub profile, led me
to make the following conclusions:

1. This is recruiter is a liar. As of late April 2017 my GitHub profile could
best be described as a barren wasteland of half-started projects.

2. I need to clean up my GitHub profile *big time* if I want to get myself out
there. I should probably put my name out there more anyway, so this is a great
wake up call to do something about it.

3. I like blogs. I read other peoples' blogs (usually through
[hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com)) all the time, and it would be pretty
neat to make myself well-known enough that people come to my blog for the same
kind of inspiration that I go to others' for.

## What do you currently know how to do?

Below are the skills I'm confident enough in to attempt to get paid for:

- Python (especially Django and AWS automation)
- Java (In general)
- Ansible for automation; automation in general, really
- CI/CD in general, and Jenkins in particular
- Scrum/Agile team management and leadership

Below are skills I feel vaguely competent at, but I wouldn't want to be my full
time job right now:
- Golang
- C/C++
- Embedded programming
- Linux Kernel development
- Web development

These are the things I'm learning:
- Programming language design
- Computer graphics
- Bouldering!
