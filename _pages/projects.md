Oh goodness is this page a work in progress. Well, let me give you a quick list
of things I'm currently working on:

- I'm currently doing the Coursera course from UWash on Programming Languages.
This is an extremely interesting course, taught in SML, Racket, and Ruby and
designed to teach you the how and why of programming language design. It's
material I never got in my undergrad experience, so I'm excited to be filling
this gap for myself.

- A couple of game prototypes are always in the pipeline for me. My current one
is a metroidvania-style game with some survival, crafting, and heavy exploration
and resource management components.

- At ViaSat, I'm currently working on a complete redesign of how we approach
CI/CD by making it auditable, replicable, highly-available, and brainlessly easy
to use. This is based around Jenkins as well as several custom webservices which
integrate with Jenkins and our source code repositories to provide a variety of
services to make the build/test/deploy cycle easier. Check back for updates, I'm
gunning to get some of this work open-sourced one day. No guarantees on that
though.
