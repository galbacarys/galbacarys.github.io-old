I'm currently working at ViaSat as a Software Engineer on our private cloud
team. Basically, I make the cloud easier to use and help people bring their
software into the modern era with continuous integration and deployment, project
gating, automated testing, and especially containerization.

My primary customers are other engineers internally, which means I get a unique
opportunity to provide support for people doing the same kind of work as me, and
I get the kind of feedback you want as an engineer: problems other engineers
see!

## Is your team hiring?

Possibly. I would encourage you to check out the ViaSat careers page if you're
interested, though, as I don't take work-related email through my personal inbox
and I do not share my work email publicly.
