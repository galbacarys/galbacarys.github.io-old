Hello, and welcome to my blog! Inside you'll find lots(?) of great(?) info to
help(?) you become a better(???) programmer, as well as lots of other random
junk.

My name is Gabe Albacarys and I'm writing this site because a recruiter told me
once that my GitHub profile was great, and it clearly wasn't; so now I'm going
to make it great! Or something.
