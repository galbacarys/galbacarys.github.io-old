<div class="page-content">
A blog by Gabe Albacarys, a full-time software engineer and part-time
dreamer. Almost certainly full of bad advice, worse explanations, and 
untold amounts of self-indulgent musing.

I'm writing this blog because a recruiter told me once that my GitHub profile 
was great, and it clearly wasn't; so now I'm going to make it...better. 
Great may prove to be a bit of a strong word.
